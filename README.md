## Introduction

GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan
application development.  It provides a simple, platform-independent API for
creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

GLFW natively supports Windows, macOS and Linux and other Unix-like systems.  On
Linux both X11 and Wayland are supported.

GLFW is licensed under the [zlib/libpng
license](https://www.glfw.org/license.html).

You can [download](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) the latest stable release
as source or Windows binaries, or fetch the `latest` branch from GitHub.  Each
release starting with 3.0 also has a corresponding [annotated
tag](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases) with source and binary archives.

The [documentation](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/) is available online and is
included in all source and binary archives.  See the [release
notes](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/news.html) for new features, caveats and
deprecations in the latest release.  For more details see the [version
history](https://www.glfw.org/changelog.html).

The `master` branch is the stable integration branch and _should_ always compile
and run on all supported platforms, although details of newly added features may
change until they have been included in a release.  New features and many bug
fixes live in [other branches](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/branches/all) until
they are stable enough to merge.

If you are new to GLFW, you may find the
[tutorial](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html) for GLFW 3 useful.  If
you have used GLFW 2 in the past, there is a [transition
guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/moving.html) for moving to the GLFW
3 API.


## Compiling GLFW

GLFW itself requires only the headers and libraries for your OS and window
system.  It does not need the headers for any context creation API (WGL, GLX,
EGL, NSGL, OSMesa) or rendering API (OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Vulkan) to enable
support for them.

GLFW supports compilation on Windows with Visual C++ 2010 and later, MinGW and
MinGW-w64, on macOS with Clang and on Linux and other Unix-like systems with GCC
and Clang.  It will likely compile in other environments as well, but this is
not regularly tested.

There are [pre-compiled Windows binaries](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
available for all supported compilers.

See the [compilation guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html) for
more information about how to compile GLFW yourself.


## Using GLFW

See the [documentation](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/) for tutorials, guides
and the API reference.


## Contributing to GLFW

See the [contribution
guide](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for
more information.


## System requirements

GLFW supports Windows XP and later and macOS 10.8 and later.  Linux and other
Unix-like systems running the X Window System are supported even without
a desktop environment or modern extensions, although some features require
a running window or clipboard manager.  The OSMesa backend requires Mesa 6.3.

See the [compatibility guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compat.html)
in the documentation for more information.


## Dependencies

GLFW itself depends only on the headers and libraries for your window system.

The (experimental) Wayland backend also depends on the `extra-cmake-modules`
package, which is used to generate Wayland protocol headers.

The examples and test programs depend on a number of tiny libraries.  These are
located in the `deps/` directory.

 - [getopt\_port](https://github.com/kimgr/getopt_port/) for examples
   with command-line options
 - [TinyCThread](https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread) for threaded
   examples
 - [glad2](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for loading OpenGL and Vulkan
   functions
 - [linmath.h](https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h) for linear algebra in
   examples
 - [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) for test and example UI
 - [stb\_image\_write](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for writing images to disk

The documentation is generated with [Doxygen](https://doxygen.org/) if CMake can
find that tool.
